# Fleet.gg

Fleet.gg is yet another Destiny 2 item manager, but simpler.
The goal of this app is to provide only with an easy way for players to interact with their characters, and vault, but also give them access to a full library of all the weapons available so they can easily inspect each weapon possible rolls, just like D2Foundry.

Think of this as having a lesser version of DIM and D2Foundry in one app.
